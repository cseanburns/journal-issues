## Introduction

SCIENCE DEPENDS ON A COMMUNICATION SYSTEM.

The internet and the web have not truly changed
how peer-reviewed publishing functions.
We continue to operate largely on what I call
a print-based workflow even if we,
the authors and editors who contribute to our
various scholarly and scientific discussions,
largely work through email and online systems
that manage the peer review and publication processes.
These systems,
rather than being transformative because they
involve digital technologies,
simply mimic the print-based workflows
journals used before the internet and the web.
That is, even if authors type papers in
word processing applications,
save those papers as DOCX files,
submit those DOCX files to journal
manuscript systems,
and then receive decisions or
reviews via those systems,
the basic processes are similar to
the basic processes before the internet and the web.
These systems closely mimic
the typewriter, the copier, and the postal service;
they do not radically transform the system,
nor do they take advantage of what
digital technologies offer.

The internet and the web have also not
substantially changed how journals publish their articles.
Most journals to this day,
even ones that are completely digital or
were born digital,
continue to publish journal issues.
This is despite that the journal issue was a
device used to bundle journal articles
for hard copy printing.
Printing journal articles as
issues makes economical sense,
as bundling is a strategy to reduce cost
by packaging multiple products,
like journal articles, as one product,
like the journal issue.
Bundling articles into journal issues also
made sense given the work flow and
analog technologies available from
the dawn of the scientific journal up
to the invention of the internet and the web.

Since we continue to operate as if we
are still using typewriters to write papers
and the postal service
to manage the submission and publication process,
I think it is safe to claim that we still reside
in what I call the *print era*.
Although we have gone digital,
we have gone digital superficially.
The technologies and work flows we use now
are merely simulacra of what we used
before the internet and the web.
I find it easy to believe that if we transported
a scientist from the 1970s to today,
and introduced them to the processes we
use in 2023,
they would catch on pretty quickly
simply because the model is basically the same.

I believe that some of the big problems
that science has today is the result of mimicking
print-based workflows within a digital environment.
The open science movement, for example,
is an attempt to make more than
the journal article accessible.
Rather, the movement is an attempt to make
the entire research process more transparent.
This is done by disseminating and communicating
as much of the work flow as possible,
which was not possible in the print era.
Although there have always been barriers to access,
the goal of publishing research is to promote access.
Science is a fundamentally communicative
system that requires knowledge sharing.
The promise with digital technologies is to
provide access to more of the research process than
analog technologies could in the print era.
However, since we continue to function using 
a print era model,
we will be hard pressed to truly realize the
full potential of open science.

There are many ways we can embrace digital
technologies that will foster our pursuit for
greater transparency in science.
Everything that we do to communicate our research
should be reconsidered based on the evidence and
with the goal to improve science and its dissemination.
Nothing we do should be left unexamined.
Since all technology offers affordances,
where such affordances influence how we act and
what we think is possible,
we should reconsider the technologies that we
use to review our manuscripts,
communicate our research,
structure our papers,
disseminate those papers,
organize our end products, and so on.
In this paper, though,
my wish is to focus on the journal issue, and
the problems it presents to us as a
relic of the print era.
I also wish to present other ways of
*bundling* our output that more fully
embrace digital technologies.
It it not that my desiderata should
necessarily be the way, though.
The two points I want to make
is that the current mimicry is detrimental
to the pursuit of not just science but also
to the pursuit of open science, and more broadly,
that we should collectively and rationally
examine our ways in order to imagine and enact improvements.
The mimicking of print-based work flows is harmful, and
advances in scientific communication
should be collectively thoughtful.

## The Journal Issue

The journal issue has had ramifications on everything
from how scientific output has been organized
to how it is retrieved.
Consider two of PubMed's date search operators:
[Date of Electronic Publication (DEP)][dep] and
[Date of Publication (DP)].
The DEP marks
"the date the publisher made an electronic
version of the article available" and
the DP "contains the full date on which
the issue of the journal was published".
Practically, this means that a journal article
may have two publication dates.
For example, suppose an article is accepted
by some journal and then is soon made available,
generally as an early access or online first article,
on the journal's website.
The date that it is made available is the DEP.
Later, the article is assigned to a journal issue,
and when that journal issue is released,
the article gets the DP.
The bibliographic record for such an article
will thus have these two dates stored in them.
Each date may be used in a PubMed search, and
using one search operator rather than
an another may mean unintentionally excluding
works that have already been published.

We highlighted one article out of many
possible candidates and we showed that this one article had
a DEP of 2015 but was not assigned a DP until 2019. This
means it took the journal four years after 'publishing' the
article to assign it to a journal issue, thereby
complicating what the term 'publishing' actually means. The
implication is that the article would not show up in search
results depending on how the date field was used to limit
results and depending on the database platform used to
search PubMed (users may have multiple options available to
them: PubMed, Ovid, EBSCOHost, ProQuest, and Web of
Science).

This is an example of mimicking
a print-based way of
doing things that's complicated by a
digital-based way of doing things.
By mimicking a print-based workflow
in our digital settings,
extra steps have been added to ill effect.
We documented this problem in a
recent publication (Burns, Nix, Shapiro, & Huber, 2021).
In that paper, we showed that a paper
on cancer made available "online first" in 2015
was not assigned to a journal issue until 2019.
The online first version of the paper was
available in PubMED soon after it was available
on the journal's website,
but the four year delay to assign the paper to an issue
meant that the paper was not available in PubMed MEDLINE
until that issue assignment.
The paper was therefore invisible to cancer researchers
who use MEDLINE and its controlled vocabulary
to finely control
their bibliographic searches.
Furthermore, since MEDLINE is available on
multiple platforms other than PubMed's,
such as Ovid, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest,
we found that for MEDLINE searches
limited by dates at least four years prior to the searches,
bibliographic databases constantly varied the number
of search results over the course of a year of searching
because of likely changes to the bibliographic records.
In the print-era,
these records were largely static.
This kind of complication is strictly the result of
cross-walking a print-based workflow onto
a digital-based workflow.

It would be incorrect to assign responsibility
to the National Library of Medicine's method of
managing bibliographic records in PubMed and MEDLINE.
Librarians' roles are to catalog, document, and organize
publishing information for retrieval.
When that publishing information changes,
librarians respond by updating the records.
The problem is that the records should not be changing.
If the journal for the article above ceased mimicking
a print-based workflow,
by publishing articles "online first" and then
later in a journal issue,
then this problem would not exist.
It could stop mimicking a print-based
workflow by ceasing to version their articles based
on when they become available online,
as online first articles,
and then by issue and volume numbers.
Issue and volume numbers are
strictly a print-based artifact,
put in use to bundle articles into booklets
for snail-based mail.
Journals that do not mimic the print-based workflow,
in this way do not have this problem.
Often these are journals that were created
after the web started and that do not print issues.
For example, [our article in PLOS ONE][burnspubmed]
was published on May 6, 2021.
The PubMed record for the article was completed
eleven days later on May 17, 2021 and
it was indexed in PubMed MEDLINE on May 18, 2021.
Because PubMed publishes articles as they are ready,
and does not version articles as online first
and then by issue and volumes,
there is no four year delay.
Articles are made available in MEDLINE much
more quickly.

Three more points to make:

POINT: BINDING TO ISSUES LED TO A FIXED
NUMBER OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED PER YEAR.
THIS CREATED FALSE SCARCITY (LOOK UP
ECONOMICS TERM FOR THIS) AND
AS A RESULT,
CREATED DEMAND AND PRESTIGE AROUND
ACCEPTANCE RATES.
A FIXED NUMBER OF PUBLISHED ARTICLES
PER YEAR ALSO ALLOWED THE DOMINANCE OF
THE IMPACT FACTOR.
A FIXED NUMBER OF PUBLISHED ARTICLES
PER YEAR ALSO LED TO REJECTION OF
NEGATIVE FINDINGS.

Binding articles to issues is strictly
a print-based way of publishing.
Printing costs money, and journal owners
often budgeted or were charged costs by
the number of pages to print per year.
When journals publish 
print hard copies,
it makes financial sense to withhold
publishing articles until enough articles have
accumulated to form a journal issue that
could be printed as a booklet and mailed out.
It also made sense to bundle articles to an
issue for organizational purposes.
Libraries in the print era could more easily
record, catalog, and organize journals by issue
than individual articles,
especially as scientific publishing skyrocketed
in the 20th century.
However, these simple, practical considerations
in the print era had profound implications for
the conduct of science.
First, binding by journal issue,
with each issue created to be a specific range
of pages,
limited space and thus created scarcity.
As a result,
this created demand and prestige around
acceptance rates since journals only had so
much space available for articles that could
be published per year and bundled
into journal issues and volumes.
A fixed number of published articles per year
also allowed for the dominance of the
journal impact factor (JIF) as a way
to measure a journal's prestige.
In the JIF,
the impact factor is the number of citations
in a given year divided by the number of
articles or publications in a given range of years.
Under an issue-based publishing model,
the number of publications in a given range of years
is largely stable.
Therefore, the JIF score varies based
on the number of citations it receives
in a given year.
As such,
the JIF really was a citation measure but for
the journal as a whole and not for any
individual article, and it was a measure
based on economic decision to bundle articles by issue.
For PLOS ONE and other journals that do not
bind by issue and allow for changes in the 
number of articles published per year,
the JIF does not make sense since the denominator
in the JIF varies by both citations and
number of publications.
CITE CRITICISM OF THE JIF

POINT: ORGANIZATIONAL. WE SEARCH FOR SPECIFIC
TOPICS TODAY IN WAYS THAT WE DIDN'T IN THE
PRINT ERA. WE ARE MUCH LESS INTERESTED IN
ISSUES SINCE OUR PRIMARY METHOD OF DISCOVERY
TODAY IS THROUGH SEARCH ENGINES AND BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES.

Literature is discovered today largely through
general and specialized search engines,
bibliographic databases, and social media.
Few people, it seems, discover new research
by perusing the table of contents, which, again,
are themselves ordered by when articles are
ready to publish and not ordered thematically.
Although websites exist that collate articles
by topic,
there is no reason for digital journals to
continue the practice of creating
tables of contents.
Instead, digital journals can create and curate
exhibitions and collections.
Articles can be assigned to multiple exhibitions
and collections based on their
main and secondary topics.
By changing this practice,
journals could increase search engine
discoverability and foster browsing and perusal.
In short, journal websites could function
as true digital libraries instead of mimicking
hard copy journal issues.
The digital era offers better ways to bundle
articles than simply by when they are ready to publish.
Journal issues bundle articles largely when they
are ready to publish.
Unless they are special issues on a topic,
journal issues are not bundled based on a theme.
The digital era offers us the ability to create
true digital libraries instead of volumes and issues.
Digital libraries could bundle articles by theme,
could create exhibits of journal articles.
Just as librarians are able to assign multiple
subject headings, and thereby access points,
to works,
journal articles could be placed in multiple
exhibits, thereby increasing the number of
access points and discovery.
This becomes a matter of curation rather
than simple bundling based on a first-in,
first-out print based model.

POINT: HAVING A SYSTEM OF ONLINE FIRST
ARTICLES THAT ARE
LATER ASSIGNED ISSUE AND VOLUME NUMBERS
ARE NOT THE ONLY WAY THAT JOURNALS CONTINUE
TO MIMIC PRINT-BASED WORKFLOWS.

POINT: BUT ALSO, SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOWS HAVE CHANGED
IN THE DIGITAL ERA, AND JOURNALS
HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RECOGNIZE AND INCORPORATE THESE
WORKFLOWS INTO THEIR PUBLISHING IN WAYS THAT DO
NOT MIMIC SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOWS IN THE PRINT ERA.

Science has long been an open process, but
that openness is constrained by the
available technologies to the scientist and
by how those technologies could scale.
During the print era,
publishing the final output of a research
project was the primary way to disseminate
research to the widest possible audience.
In the digital era,
much more of the scientific workflow is
conducted on computers and can be
disseminated just as widely as
the final research paper could in the print era.
Journals should be active members in this process.

---

What best serves scholarly communication? Or the
dissemination of scholarly output? Does our current system
support what is best? How does 'what is best?' vary by
discipline?

There are two problems with the current system. First, it
just happened. That is, it was not designed. There was no
evidence to support how it developed. It was simply based on
existing technologies and workflows for communicating
information. Second, the way it happened was shaped by the
affordances of the technology of the time, which were
print-based affordances.

When digital publishing became available, the affordances
offered by print could be copied over to the online system
because an online system can encompass and include
print-based affordances. But digital publishing can afford
much more, and it is a result of our lack of collective
imagination to adopt these new affordances as well as
institutional pressures, like tenure and grant funding, and
self-interest, like number of papers published and number of
citations received and number of "high impact" journals to
publish in, and market forces, that do not incentive
journal publishers to adopt what's best for science,
to keep doing the same thing we did in the 19th
and 20th centuries.

In this paper, I first outline all the characteristics of
scholarly publishing and dissemination that are artifacts or
vestiges of the print era. Then I address each artifact to
identify its purpose in a digital paradigm. Finally, I
outline the affordances offered by digital publishing and
dissemination that might enhance scholarly publishing and
dissemination, enhancements based on evidence, and how
those enhancements might vary by discipline, from the
humanities, the social sciences, to the life and physical
sciences.

Thesis: scholarly publishing exists as if we lived in the
print only era. That is, scholarly publishing must stop
conforming to the affordances dictated by print publishing
and start conforming to the affordances offered by digital
publishing. To do that, it must detach itself from
traditional journal based metrics, which are also confined
to a print era framework.

Goal: for scholarly publishing to become fully digital, it
needs to be proactive. It needs to focus on design and
research based on scholarly publishing, including
bibliometrics, information retrieval, information seeking,
access, etc. It needs to stop being reactive. It needs to
stop acting as if it was born from a print age. It needs to
act as if was born digital.

Goal revised: get rid of issue based publishing (although
there are a number of other things to do

It is no small statement to say that the web has
revolutionized the scholarly communication system. How
authors publish, manuscripts are reviewed, journals are
disseminated, costs are distributed, and research is
evaluated are some of the elements of the system that have
been subject to substantial change. One other change has
been the rise of the so-called megajournal. Beginning in
2003 with PLOS ONE, the megajournal has become an ever more
important venue for scholarly publishing as well as a source
for advancing the technology of publishing on the web. Newer
megajournals in various fields, such as the social sciences,
computer science, biology and medicine, and so forth have
come into being, and submissions and publication rates for
at least some of these journals have increased at rates that
rise year after year. This small fact alone, the rate of
increase of articles published year after year via
megajournals, indicates a significant change in how we
should conceive of the megajournal and even whether it
should be conceptualized as a journal.

The increase in the number of peer-reviewed published items
per year is possible for two broad reasons, and the web has
made both of the reasons more feasible. First, it is
relatively easy to launch a new journal, especially one that
does not provide print issues. Second, web-based only
journals are potentially released from constraints on the
number of pages that can be printed each year. This second
reason explains the possibility of journals like *PLOS ONE*.
Recently referred to as a megajournal, *PLOS ONE* is one of
the first journals to take greater advantage of being
a completely online, web-based publication platform. 

Despite that journals have been publishing online since the
early 1990s, the rate of increase of published articles is
possible in large part because megajournals function as the
first scholarly publication platform that fully breaks away
from the print paradigm of scholarly publishing. It is
because of this break that we need a better theory of the
journal and the megajournal in order to explain more about
scholarly communicaton and publication behaviors and
practices. Here I propose that we conceptualize the
megajournal as a kind of digital library, or that we even
begin to work toward the megajournal, and digital publishing
in general, toward a digital library model. In this paper,
I will differentiate between the print paradigm scholarly
publishing and the web paradigm of scholarly publishing, and
show how this differentiation indicates a major break away
from the print model and results in a digital library;
second, I will show how moving toward a digital library
could foster a healthier scientific and scholarly publishing
model. [**Define healthier**]

## Print paradigm

One the key characteristic of the print model of scholarly
publishing (and most any periodical publishing) is the
constraint on the number of pages a journal is alloted to
publish each year. The constraint is largely an economical
one that is placed on the journal due to the costs of
printing and shipping. 

Given enough interest in publishing under a certain title,
under the print model, it does not make economical or much
other sense to disseminate to libraries and individual
subscribers scholarly articles one at a time, just as it
would not make sense to disseminate a newspaper article to
readers on a per article basis. As a result, early
publishers managed the dissemination of journals by bundling
articles together and issuing them as such. These issues,
sent out irregularly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or
at some other periodic frequency, is how journals have
operated since some of the early days.

With the rise of print and electronic indexes and databases,
and with these tools the ability to locate articles by
subject or topic matter, whether by indexed terms or by
keyword search, the journal article began to become more
pronounced than the journal issue. Not only were scholars
provided tools to locate articles pertaining to their
interests, especially of articles that were published in
journals outside the journals they normally followed,
non-researchers, such as students and the public, also
benefited from more fine tune access to articles that were
provided by these databases and indexes.


THAT COMMUNICATION SYSTEM IS BASED ON DEVELOPMENTS THAT
LARGELY OCCURED DURING THE PRINT AGE.

The influence of print culture cannot be underestimated. As
@8UJPWJE6#bartling14 wrote, the publishing culture "is
affected by the journal system created when results simply
had to be printed on paper" and that now, despite having
digital affordances at our disposal that are limited only by
our imagination, "we are currently in a 'legacy gap'" (p.
8).

- Print paradigm
  - Publication constrained by number of pages alloted to
    journals per year
  - Economies required bundling by issue (doesn't make sense
    to disseminate journal articles separately, by pamphlet,
    so to speak)
  - Bundling, however, brought some benefits
      - disciplinary identity – a sense of the collective
        disciplinary self
      - The Library Quarterly, College and Research
        Libraries, Journal of American Documentation (later
        JASIST), etc. helped form the library and
        information science identity
    - Bundling also influenced evaluation of scholarship
        - The Journal Impact Factor, e.g., is a measure of a
          journal's impact and not individual article impact

AS SCIENCE COMMUNICATION BECAME DIGITAL, INSTEAD OF
RETHINKING HOW THE NEW AFFORDANCES OFFERED BY THE DIGITAL
MEDIUM COULD BENEFIT SCIENCE COMMUNICATION, MOST PUBLISHERS
MAINLY TRANSFERRED A PRINT MODEL OF PUBLISHING TO THE
DIGITAL REALM. EXAMPLES OF THIS TRANSFER INCLUDE x, y, AND
z.

1. Page
  - margins
  - headings
  - in-text citations
  - bibliography at the end
  - footnotes and endnotes
  - margins are still necessary for readability but should
    be adaptive based on screen size, etc. as well as font
  - in-text citations should always be links. some journals
    do this, but not all.
  - bibliography could be integrated within the text, some
    journals do this 2. Authorship
  - the person writing the text
  - text / manuscript centered
  - authorship is text centered, on who wrote the actual
    text, but who else should receive credit; what other
    roles are there; why the primacy of "author" 3. Journal
  - issues
    - issue that includes a set number of articles
    - issues published and disseminated out a regular,
      periodic intervals
  - volumes
    - issues assigned to volumes
    - libraries using book binding services to make volumes
      into self-contained hard copies
    - volumes cataloged using LCC etc; receive subject
      headings
    - volumes stored on library shelves; maybe circulated
    - Journals should publish daily. Stop publishing based
      on issues or use some other category to bundle; the
      idea of a digital library makes more sense 4. Peer
      review
  - peer review focuses on the whole manuscript but not on
    other components, such as data repositories, code
    repositories, etc
  - peer review process functions today like a mail in
    system. Even though software may aid in peer review
    management, it's still the same paradigm
  - editors and reviewers receive Word or PDF files
  - editors and reviewers have to complete forms 5. Paper
    formatting
  - so many styles to choose from. there may only be a
    handful of common styles, but there are thousands of
    variations. For example, Zotero offers users over 10,300
    styles to use. Although journals may specify something
    like APA, they may also be behind in versions (e.g., APA
    6th edition versus APA 7th edition), and they may tweak
    the style for some particular but lost to history
    reason. The Chicago style has different editions but
    also different versions: author-date, full note, library
    list, note. Why not just use links? Special permanent
    links, so some variation on the basic link to allow for
    multiple, accessible in-text citations.

Publishers have largely responded to the digital age by
publishing out of volume, early first. This complicates the
bibliographic universe. The bibliographic universe includes
all bibliographic entities and their relationships
regardless of format [NOTE: need better definition].

1. Goal additional: publish HTML only. Include an ability to print to
   PDF or a print-focused CSS style sheet. Stop publish tables as
   images. The data should be parsable by software.

2. Goal additional: make information extractable generally by software.
   The paper itself should be a source of data (for computer programs)
   and not just a source of information (for people).

While PDFs have become modern, in the sense that they
contain links, code, etc., even these documents take on an
aura of fixededness

**NOTE**: Provide other examples of print artifacts that
continue to this day

Scholarly publishing, in short, has failed to take
advantage of the digital affordances that are offered
today.

Part of the problem in adoption is that although much more
is possible, too much is still in flux. There are multiple
interfaces to documents, multiple devices, multiple etc and
copyright obstructs access, erects paywalls, and funnels
readers through library technologies that prevent or hinder
sharing (e.g., the proxy URL).

## The Issue with Issues

Despite this increase and more specific access, the bundling
of journals into issues and then into volumes has largely
defined the entire scholarly communication system, and this
impact has had some benefits and some costs. One of the
major benefits is that by bundling a set of articles into
a journal that publishes by issue, as befits a print model,
publishers, scholarly societies, and others have helped
shaped disciplinary identity, or a sense of the collective
disciplinary self. This is because journal issues and
volumes provide a sense of focus and a research direction
that not only maps specific fields but also validates the
research that is published in those fields. 

The bundling has also influenced the evaluation of
scholarship. The journal impact factor is a (contested)
measure of a journal's impact, but it is a measure that only
makes sense when a journal publishes a fairly constant set
of articles per year. That is, in order to measure changes
in average citation counts, whether it is an average over
a two or five year period, it helps to hold at a constant
the rate of articles published per year. If the rate of
articles that are published each year varies considerably,
then it becomes difficult to use the journal impact factor
to compare average citation rates across years, even for
a single journal. As an example, Figure 1 shows the citable
counts of published items for the journal JASIST over a five
year period and then imagines a generous citation count
increase of 10% year over year. Holding the number of
citable items at a constant year over year, the journal
impact factor score in this scenario rises substantially.

The megajournal, however, is much more susceptible to
varying rates of change to the number of citable items that
it publishes. In Figure 2, we can see the real numbers,
derived from Web of Science and the Journal Citation
Reports, for *PLOS ONE* since its inception. While not all
megajournals will be as successful as *PLOS ONE*, as far
a popularity for submissions, we see that since the rate of
published articles has increased at a rate faster than the
rate of citations, the journal impact factor has decreased,
albeit minutely, over the time span.

The acceptance rate of a journal has long been used as an
indicator of a journal's quality. Such that a journal with
a 10% acceptance rate is held to higher esteem, other things
being equal, than a journal with a 50% acceptance rate. But
the acceptance rate of a journal is a function of the print
model [@6V8SGUUC#zuckerman71]. When space is limited
(available print pages per year), i.e., a journal has page
constraints to consider, then its real estate becomes, by
this constraint, prized. 

Some have criticized megajournals like *PLOS ONE* for having
an acceptance rate of nearly 70%, which is also the
acceptance rate of at least one other megajournal, *PeerJ*.
It is still left to consideration and to empirical research
the degree of explanation about what the difference means
between the acceptance rate of a megajournal and the
acceptance rate of a comparable general science journal,
like *Nature*. Say, e.g., that *Nature* has an acceptance
rate of 10% and *PLOS ONE* has an acceptance rate of 70%. Is
the difference between these two rates explained simply by
the lack of page constraints for PLOS ONE? How much does the
acceptance rate of a journal a function of this print
contraint? How much does the acceptance rate of a journal
a function of gatekeeping?

[ To test this, ...]

Some megajournals only accept manuscripts that belong to
certain subject areas. *PeerJ*, one of the more recent
megajournals, has two publishing outlets: the main, original
PeerJ outlet publishes in the biological, life, and health
sciences; and PeerJ Computer Science, which publishes in the
computer and information sciences. There are three main ways
to locate and access articles in PeerJ by subject matter.
Users can search the site, locate articles by subject
keyword, which *PeerJ* refers to as an "overlay" (e.g., the
Zoology Overlay or the Genomics Overlay), or browse by
collections. 

*PLOS ONE*, however, accepts manuscripts from any subject
area. Like PeerJ, it filters by keywords and ....



THIS HAS HAD RAMIFICATIONS FOR NOT SIMPLY THE COMMUNICATION
OF SCIENCE BUT ALSO FOR THE ENTIRE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE
(DEFINE BIBLIOGRAPHIC UNIVERSE), SUCH AS PUBLICATION DATES

Print era affordances include: publishing by issue and
volume. Journal articles were bound by issue and then by
volume because they were printed. It was economical to
release a set of articles in an issue, rather than mailing
each out to readers one-by-one. Then issues could be later
bound into volumes by libraries for collocation and storage.
This doesn't make sense anymore. Further, printing costs
constrained the number of pages that journals could print in
a single year. This influenced acceptance rates and later
journal-based metrics, since the latter are influenced by
the number of articles and like published each year and how
many citations that, generally, fixed number of articles
receive in the following years. This fixed number became a
motivation to keep the number of articles published fixed at
the same number each year. The only reason why this behavior
continues is because journal-based metrics are determined by
total documents printed, and this has a major impact on the
production of knowledge. It determines what can be printed,
it determines how many journals exist (journals are created
because of supply and demand, and if one journal is too
restrictive, then it means that other, less restrictive
journals are created to meet demand.

- Data, small and big
  - The rise of data science
  - Still in the early stages of codification, but as many
    of you will recognize, some of the hardest problems with
    analysis concern pre-analytic work, and the problems
    become exponential as they scale from small data to big
    data. These problems include:
  - locating data
  - gathering it
  - cleaning it
  - describing it
  - organizing it
  - providing access to it
- Problem solving
  - The codification problem (tacit/unknown to explcit) is
    largely focused on problem solving
  - Polanyi: "Thus the scientific interest—or scientific
    value—of a contribution is formed by three factors: its
    exactitude, its systematic importance, and the intrinsic
    interest of its subject matter"
  - Merton: "The role of outstanding scientists in
    influencing younger associates is repeatedly emphasized
    in the interviews with laureates. Almost invariably they
    lay great emphasis on the importance of problem-finding,
    not only problem-solving. They uniformly express the
    strong conviction that what matters most in their work
    is a developing sense of taste, of judgment, in seizing
    upon problems that are of fundamental importance"

HOWEVER, THE DIGITAL REALM OFFERS AFFORDANCES THAT COULD
BENEFIT SCIENCE COMMUNICATION.

- Web paradigm A) Introduction of PloS One in 2003
  - Most journals today are still bound by the print
    paradigm
  - PloS One and later megajournals have been able to free
    themselves of that paradigm a) articles are published as
    they become ready b) move from a journal centric
    publication model to a article centric publication model
    c) talk about table B) Web paradigm also frees journals
    to experiment with different parts of the scientific
    process
  - open peer review a) pit two theoretical frameworks
    against each other:
           - assumption: science "conceived of as a system
             of communication" (Merton)
           - social constructivism (fuzzy authorship) versus
             the normative view of science (strong
             authorship but communism)
           - fuzzy versus strong authorship raises
             epistemological issues about author
             contributions b) better view of the scientific
             work flow
  - blogging, and other social computing activities, as a
    certified part scientific communication process
  - dissemination of pre-prints to subject and institutional
    repositories
  - dissemination of code to code repositories and managers,
    such as GitHub
  - dissemination of supplementary and non-textual
    artifacts, such as on Figshare
  - collaborative and open view editing of scientific
    manuscripts
    - better view has enabled better tracking
      - the first instinct was to track for impact (e.g.,
        altmetrics)
      - but the better view has the potential to offer
        increased insight into knowledge creation and
        management d) additional implications include:
      - decentralization of scholarly power (controlled
        study paper—Merton effect; information retrieval) e)
        better view should enable better codification of
        knowledge required to conduct science
      - with increased access to how people do science,
        there should be increased access to documenting the
        scientific work flow

THESE AFFORDANCES BEGIN NOT WITH THE OUTPUT, E.G., THE
JOURNAL ARTICLE, AS MOST PUBLISHERS HAVE FOCUSED ON, BUT
WITH THE ENTIRE SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOW.

IN THE PRINT ERA, A SCIENTIST'S WORKFLOW WAS PREDOMINANTLY
CAPTURED IN THE FINAL OUTPUT, THE SCIENTIFIC PAPER (OF
COURSE, POSTERS, TALKS, ETC EXISTED, BUT STILL, THE OUTPUT
WAS LIMITED).

IN THE PRINT ERA, A SCIENTIST'S OUTPUT WAS OFFICE ORIENTED
(SEE HEALY ON THIS).

IN THE DIGITAL ERA, A SCIENTIST IS CONNECTED, IS ONLINE,
CONDUCTS THEIR WORK ONLINE, INTERACTS WITH OTHERS ONLINE,
AND SO FORTH. tHE DIGITAL ERA IS FRIENDLY TO THE SCIENTIST'S
WORKFLOW. aLSO, RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS WITH
THIS, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ETC

SCIENCE COMMUNICATION IN THE DIGITAL REALM CAN ENCOMPASS
THAT ENTIRE WORKFLOW AND NOT ONLY THE PRIMARY OUTPUT -- THE
SCIENTIFIC PAPER.

- highlighting the scientific work flow enables us to query
  the fundamentals of science
- this is evident in the open science movement and offers
  the ability to test fundamental assumptions about science,
  scientific reproducibility, and scientific replication f)
  (relatively) small sample statistics is a good example

THERE ARE EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO CAPTURE MORE OF THAT WORKFLOW,
AND THESE EFFORTS VARY BY DISCIPLINE

BUT REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIFIC EFFORTS, MOST JOURNALS STILL
EXIST AS SILOS TO THESE WORKFLOWS.

ERGO, WE MIGHT CONCLUDE, THAT JOURNALS, A PRODUCT OF THE
PRINT ERA, AS MOST CONTINUE TO EXIST TODAY, ARE THEMSELVES
OBSOLETE.

THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING COULD BE BASED ON
PORTFOLIOS AND DIGITAL LIBRARIES. WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF PLOS
ONE AND PEERJ, I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHERE SUCH PUBLISHERS WERE
HEADED, BUT MORE CAN BE DONE.

- Publishing:
  - publish as-ready instead of by issue or volume; the acceptance rate
    could be redefined and possible raised since it would no longer be
    based on the budget a journal has to publish in print (stop
    publishing in print); could increase the speed of publication 
  - by detaching from printing, no longer desk rejecting by word count
    or length of paper
- Paper:
  - make HTML only
  - make paper a source of data
  - tables should be HTML tables and not images of tables
  - statistical information should be extractable programmatically
- Emded metadata in HTML; use semantic HTML5
- Paper as unit should be archivable; should be self-contained
  - no part of the published web page that a paper is on should rely on
    other technologies to display; everything needed to display the page
    should be on the single page
- Relationship with preprint archives? Follow chain of providence? For
  example, in my PLOS ONE article, there's no connection, even though
  I remember the process stating there would be, to the PLOS ONE article
  and the prepint on bioArxiv.

THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING FROM THE SCIENTIST'S
PERSPECTIVE, A SERIES OF TOOLS THAT DO ONE THING AND DO ONE
THING WELL.

THESE TOOLS COULD ACT AS PIPES THAT REDIRECT OUTPUT,
AUTOMATICALLY, TO OTHER TOOLS FOR VARIOUS SORTS OF
PROCESSING.

Things to take advantage of the digital:

categorize these:

- no multiple publishing dates
- HTML primacy
- the ability to extra data from articles,
    - including references
    - tables
    - figures/plots
    - text
    - statistics

make the article a true data source. not just a source for
reading, but a source that is machine readable

- semantic data in each article
    - html semantic
    - linked data semantic

- don't require Microsoft Word
    - allow multiple formats if formats have standards that are open

- allow greater interoperability
    - copyright prevents lots of interoperability

EACH OUTPUT ALONG THE WAY WOULD HAVE A PERSISTENT IDENTIFIER
AND COULD BE OPEN (AT SOME POINT WHEN READY).

THE 'FINAL' PRODUCT COULD BE A FINAL WRITE-UP OR PRESENTATION
INSTEAD OF A 'PAPER' (WHAT ELSE RINGS OF THE PRINT REALM
MORE THAN THE WORD 'PAPER' FOR AN ARTICLE).

The Journal as a Digital Library

GET RID OF ARTICLES. CREATE PIPELINES. ALL PARTS OF THE
WORKFLOW CAN BECOME INTERCONNECTED.

SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD BE TRULY KNOWLEDGE PRODUCING.
