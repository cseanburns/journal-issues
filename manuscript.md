# Introduction

Science depends on a communication system.
The internet and the web provide the infrastructure
and tools to support that communicative system.
Yet despite that they have played a developing role
as a communicative system in the last thirty years,
they have not truly changed
how peer-reviewed publishing works.
We continue to operate largely on
a print-based workflow even if we,
the authors and editors who contribute to our
various scholarly and scientific discussions,
mostly work through email and online systems
that manage the peer review and publication processes.
These systems mimic the print-based workflows
journals used before the internet and the web.
They have not been transformative even though
they involve digital technologies.
Authors may type papers in
word processing applications,
save those papers as DOCX files,
submit those DOCX files to journal
manuscript systems,
and then receive decisions or
reviews via those systems.
However, the basic processes are similar to
the basic processes used before the internet and the web.
These processes closely mimic
the typewriter, the copier, and the postal service;
they do not radically transform the system,
nor do they take advantage of what
digital technologies offer.

The internet and the web have also not
substantially changed how journals publish articles.
Many journals,
even ones that are completely digital or
were born digital,
continue to publish journal issues.
This is despite that the journal issue was a
device used to bundle journal articles
for hard copy printing.
Printing hard copy journal articles as
issues made economical sense.
Bundling is a strategy to reduce cost
by packaging multiple products,
like journal articles, as one product,
like journal issues.
Bundling articles into journal issues also
made sense given the workflow and
analog technologies available from
the dawn of the scientific journal up
to the invention of the internet and the web.
It simply made sense, in the print era,
to mail issues (collections of articles)
rather than to mail individual articles.

The influence of print era
cannot be underestimated.
As @8UJPWJE6#bartling14 wrote,
the publishing culture
"is affected by the journal system
created when results simply had
to be printed on paper" and that now,
despite having digital affordances at our
disposal that are limited only by
our imagination,
"we are currently in a 'legacy gap'" (p. 8).

Since we continue to operate as if we
use typewriters to write papers
and the postal service
to manage communication about the
submission and publication process,
I think it is safe to claim that
we still reside in the *print era*.
Although we have gone digital,
we have gone digital superficially.
The technologies and workflows we use now
are merely simulacra of what we used
before the internet and the web.
I find it easy to believe that if we transported
a scientist from the 1970s to today,
and introduced them to the processes we
use in 2023,
they would catch on pretty quickly
simply because the model is basically the same.

I believe that some of the big problems
that science has today is the result of mimicking
those print-based workflows within a digital environment.
The open access movement is concerned with making
the journal article and other traditional
scholarly outputs more accessible.
The open science movement goes further.
It is an attempt to make
the entire research process more transparent.
This is done by disseminating and communicating
as much of the workflow as possible,
which was not possible at scale in the print era.
Although there have always been barriers to access,
the goal of publishing research has long been
fundamentally communicative and about knowledge sharing
(even if the incentives have presided elsewhere).
The promise with digital technologies is to
provide access to more of the research process than
analog technologies could in the print era.
However, since we continue to function using 
a print era model,
we will be hard pressed to truly realize the
full potential of open science.

There are many ways we can embrace digital
technologies that foster our pursuit for
greater transparency in science.
To accomplish this goal,
everything that we do to communicate our research
should be re-evaluated based on the evidence and
with the goal to improve science and its dissemination.
Nothing we do should be left unexamined or unquestioned.
Since all technology offers affordances,
where such affordances influence how we act and
what we think is possible,
we should reconsider the technologies that we
use to review our manuscripts,
communicate our research,
structure our papers,
disseminate those papers,
organize our end products, and so on.

In this paper, though,
my wish is to focus on the journal issue, and
the problems it presents to us as a
relic of the print era.
I also wish to present other ways of
*bundling* our output that more fully
embrace digital technologies.
My solutions are only suggestions, and
I raise them to stimulate discussion.
However, there two points I want to make.
First, the current way we mimic the print era
in our publication workflow is detrimental
to the pursuit of not just science but also
to the pursuit of open science.
Second, and more broadly,
instead of leaving progress to random entities,
we should collectively and rationally
examine our ways in order
to imagine and enact improvements.

# The Journal Issue

Bundling by journal issue has had ramifications
on everything from how scientific output
has been organized to how it is retrieved.
In this section, I discuss two overarching
ways that journal issues have harmed
the communication of science,
and therefore, science itself.
First, I discuss how the print era of
bundling created real scarcity and
how that scarcity became a phantom with
the introduction of digital technologies.
Second, I discuss how journal publishers
have created complexity by publishing multiple
versions of articles that attempt to satisfy
print era and also digital era workflows.

## Scarcity

Journal articles were bundled by issue
because they were printed.
It was economical to release a
set of articles in an issue,
rather than mailing each article to subscribers one-by-one.
Printing costs limited the number of pages
that journals could print in a single year.
This constraint created scarcity, and
scarcity meant that editors had to make
decisions about what to print and what not to print.

Scarcity creates value, and
one metric of value is the acceptance rate.
The lower the acceptance rate,
the higher the scarcity value.
The acceptance rate of a journal
has long been used as an indicator
of a journal's quality.
A journal with a 10% acceptance rate
is held to higher esteem,
other things being equal,
than a journal with a 50% acceptance rate.
The acceptance rate of a journal is
a function of the print model [@6V8SGUUC#zuckerman71].
When space is limited
(available print pages per year),
i.e., a journal has page constraints to consider,
then its real estate becomes,
by this constraint, prized (@W28UHWAI#piller22). 

Journal-based metrics,
such as the *Journal Impact Factor (JIF)*,
are based on the scarcity value.
This means that bundling by issue
has influenced the evaluation of scholarship.
The JIF is a (contested) measure of a journal's impact,
but it is a measure that only makes sense
when a journal publishes a fairly constant set
of articles per year.
That is, in order to measure changes
in average citation counts,
whether it is an average over
a two or five year period,
it helps to hold at a constant the
rate of articles published per year.
If the rate of articles that are published
each year varies considerably,
then it becomes meaningless to use the JIF
to compare average citation rates across years,
even for a single journal.

Seeking higher JIF scores becomes a motivation
to keep the number of published articles relatively fixed
at the same number each year.
The only reason to keep static the number of articles
each year,
especially with digital only journals,
or perhaps even why journals keep producing hard copy,
is because the JIF is determined by
the ratio of citations to total documents printed
within a time range.
If journals increase their publication output,
then their JIF scores will drop
until the citations can catch up
with the new publication rates.
This has a major impact on the production of knowledge.
It determines what can be printed, and
it determines how many journals exist.
Journals are created because of supply and demand.
If one journal is too restrictive,
then it means that other,
less restrictive journals are created to meet demand.

## Bibliographic Record

Bundling by journal issue has had ramifications
on how bibliographic records and information retrieval.
Journals that continue to publish hard copy,
and therefore, publish by issue,
publish articles as online first or ahead-of-print,
or similarly named, articles,
and think this is satisfactory (@W28UHWAI#piller22).
These online first articles become attached
to journal issues at some point in their future,
usually when the journal has caught up with
their backlog.
The result is that these articles become versioned:
articles online and fully formatted but ahead of print and
not attached to a journal issue,
and articles in print and attached to an issue.
This result means that such articles receive at least
two publication dates.
The first date reflects the online first version.
The second date reflects the date of the journal issue.
The time difference between these two versions may
be years.

These dates are recorded in the bibliographic records,
and consequently,
this impacts information search and retrieval.
Consider two of PubMed's date search operators:
[Date of Electronic Publication (DEP)][dep] and
[Date of Publication (DP)][dp].
The DEP marks
"the date the publisher made an electronic
version of the article available."
Therefore, the DEP can be the date an article
was made available online first and
not attached to an issue.
The DP "contains the full date on which
the issue of the journal was published".
This means that these journal articles
may have at least two publication dates.
For example, suppose an article is accepted
by some journal and then is quickly made available,
generally as an early access or online first article,
on the journal's website.
The date that it is made available is the DEP.
Later, the article is assigned to a journal issue,
and when that journal issue is released,
the article gets the DP.
The bibliographic record for such an article
records these two dates.
Each date may be used in a PubMed search since
these are different date fields in PubMed search, and
using one search operator rather than
an another may mean unintentionally excluding
works that have already been published.

This is an example of mimicking
a print-based way of
doing things that's complicated by a
digital-based way of doing things.
By mimicking a print-based workflow
in our digital settings,
extra steps have been added to ill effect.
In our paper [@H8ZB2U8T#burns21],
we showed that a paper
on cancer made available "online first" in 2015
was not assigned to a journal issue until 2019.
The online first version of the paper was
available in PubMed soon after it was available
on the journal's website as an online first article,
but the four year delay to assign the paper to an issue
meant that the paper was not available in PubMed MEDLINE
until that issue assignment.
The paper was therefore invisible to cancer researchers
who use MEDLINE and its controlled vocabulary
to finely control
their bibliographic searches.
Furthermore, since MEDLINE is available on
multiple platforms other than PubMed's,
such as Ovid, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest,
we found that for MEDLINE searches
limited by dates at least four years prior to the searches,
bibliographic databases constantly varied the number
of search results over the course of a year of searching
because of likely changes to the bibliographic records.
In the print-era,
these records were largely fixed.
Because many journals,
especially those that continue to print hard copy,
try to have it both ways (print and digital workflows),
the result is over complicated searching.
This kind of complication is strictly the result of
cross-walking a print-based workflow onto
a digital-based workflow.

It would be incorrect to assign responsibility
to the National Library of Medicine's method of
managing bibliographic records in PubMed and MEDLINE.
Librarians' roles are to catalog, document, and organize
publishing information for retrieval.
When that publishing information changes,
librarians respond by updating the records.
The problem is that the records should not be changing.
If the journal for the article above ceased mimicking
a print-based workflow,
by publishing articles "online first" and then
later in a journal issue,
then this problem would not exist.
It could stop mimicking a print-based
workflow by ceasing to version their articles based
on when they become available online,
as online first articles,
and then by issue and volume numbers.
Issue and volume numbers are
strictly a print-based artifact,
put in use to bundle articles into booklets
for snail-based mail.
Journals that do not mimic the print-based workflow,
in this way do not have this problem.
Often these are journals that were created
after the web started and that do not print issues.

# Solutions

Literature is discovered today largely through
general and specialized search engines,
bibliographic databases,
and social media [@BBQSSXP9#burns13].
Few people, it seems, discover new research
by perusing the table of contents, which again,
are themselves ordered by when articles are
ready to publish, and not ordered thematically.
Although websites exist that collate articles by topic,
there is no reason for journals to
continue the practice of creating tables of contents.
It is a fundamentally poor way to
collect and organize information,
especially for journals that are completely digital.

Instead, digital journals can create and curate
exhibitions and collections.
They can become true digital libraries.
Digital libraries have the advantage of offering
multiple ways to organize and classify the works
in their collections, and
this creates opportunities to forge and design
web interfaces that match those collections [@HKNRR9KR#pomerantz07].
For example, articles can be assigned to
multiple exhibitions and collections based
on their main and secondary topics.
By changing to this practice,
journals could increase search engine
discoverability and foster browsing and perusal.
Browsing and perusal have long been just as important
parts of information retrieval as information search has
been [@ADY7ARVY#bush45h; @R3I5GWL2#lesk12].

In short, journal websites could function
as true digital libraries instead of mimicking
the format and practices of hard copy journal issues.
Just as librarians may assign multiple
subject headings, and thereby access points,
to works,
journal articles could be placed in multiple
exhibits and collections,
thereby increasing the number of
access points and discovery.
This becomes a matter of curation rather
than simple bundling based on a first-in,
first-out print based model.
Even for journals that still need to
print hard copy,
it is still possible for them to give
primacy to a digital workflow rather
than a print workflow.

We might conclude that many journals,
as products of the print era or
as adopters of print workflows,
as most continue to exist today,
are themselves obsolete.
The future of scientific publishing could
be based on curating and creating digital libraries
of scientific and other scholarly output.
Other improvements can be made, too.
Articles themselves can be re-evaluated.
Many journals to this day publish tables
as PDF, JPG, or PNG files,
which makes them largely inaccessible to
data extraction.
Journals could develop better relationships
with pre-print archives and establish
a chain of providence that links pre-prints
to their peer-reviewed outputs.
Other outputs could be more obviously connected
to journal articles,
such as data journals and
computational notebooks [@LU43KXNS#perkel18].
Acceptance rates could become a thing of
the past since space, theoretically, is unlimited,
as the journal *eLife* is exploring [@DJH4SHN5#else22].

In summary,
journals could start imagining themselves
as part of the larger scholarly web,
which itself was designed to be interconnected,
instead of designing their sites as
silos that consider the journal article
as the final, definitive, end product.
Current scholarly publishing is
woefully outdated and remains loyal
to print era workflows and processes.
By embracing the digital,
we can multiple publishing dates,
give primacy to HTML output,
make articles sources of data
(machine readable) and
not simply sources for reading,
create greater interoperability,
eliminate the requirement to submit
manuscripts as word processing files [@LBXUS5ZD#healy19].
With these and other improvements,
such a system would be truly knowledge producing.

# Conclusion

Science depends on a communication system, and
the current communication system is largely
based on the internet and the web.
Despite that, much of scholarly publishing
continues to function as if it were still
the print era.
This is evident in the way journals
continue to publish, for example,
by bundling articles into journal issues.
A host of problems arises from this that
impacts what journals publish,
how metrics are calculated,
how acceptance rates became prestige markers, and
how information is organized and retrieved.

I offered several solutions to improve
the way science and scholarship is published.
My goal is to foster discussion since
actual solutions depend on the needs of the
community and not on the desiderata of
any specific individual.
However, I do believe that my main solution,
re-conceiving the journal as a digital library,
is more aligned with what the internet and
the web affords and that continuing to apply
print era workflows and practices to scholarly
publishing is harmful.

In the end, solutions must be rational, evidence-based,
and solved collectively.
The internet and the web have been disruptive, and
the transition to digital publishing has
been slow and left to individual entities to make progress.
The rush to publish may leave us un-reflective on
our practices,
and I sincerely believe that we should be always asking
ourselves some basic questions:
What best serves scholarly communication?
Or the dissemination of scholarly output?
Does our current system support what is best?
How does 'what is best?' vary by discipline?

When digital publishing became available,
the affordances offered by print could be
copied over to the online system
because an online system can encompass and
include print-based affordances.
But digital publishing can afford much more,
and it is a result of our lack of collective
imagination to adopt these new affordances
as well as institutional pressures,
like tenure and grant funding, and
self-interest,
like number of papers published,
number of citations received, and
number of "high impact" journals to publish in,
and market forces, that do not incentive
journal publishers to adopt what's best for science,
to keep doing the same thing we did in the 19th
and 20th centuries.
