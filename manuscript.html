<p>Science depends on a communication system, and today that is largely
provided by digital technologies such as the internet and web. Despite
that digital technologies provide the infrastructure for that
communication system, peer-reviewed journals continue to mimic workflows
and processes from the print era. This paper focuses on one artifact
from the print era, the journal issue, and describes how this artifact
has been detrimental the communication of science and therefore to
science itself. To replace the journal issue, this paper argues that
scholarly publishing and journals could more fully embrace digital
technologies by creating digital libraries to present scholarly
output.</p>
</div>
</header>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Science depends on a communication system. The internet and the web
provide the infrastructure and tools to support that communicative
system. Yet despite that they have played a major role as a
communicative system in the last thirty years, they have not truly
changed how peer-reviewed publishing works. Instead, we continue to
operate largely on a print-based workflow even if we, the authors and
editors who contribute to our various scholarly and scientific
discussions, mostly work through email and online systems that manage
the peer review and publication processes. These systems mimic the
print-based workflows journals used before the internet and the web.
They have not been transformative even though they involve digital
technologies. Authors may type papers in word processing applications,
save those papers as DOCX files, submit those DOCX files to journal
manuscript systems, and then receive decisions or reviews via those
systems. However, the basic processes are similar to the basic processes
used before the internet and the web. These processes closely mimic the
typewriter, the copier, and the postal service; they do not radically
transform the system, nor do they take advantage of what digital
technologies offer.</p>
<p>The internet and the web have also not substantially changed how
journals publish articles. Many journals, even ones that are completely
digital or were born digital, continue to publish journal issues. This
is despite that the journal issue was a device used to bundle journal
articles for hard copy printing. Printing hard copy journal articles as
issues made economical sense. Bundling is a strategy to reduce cost by
packaging multiple products, like journal articles, as one product, like
journal issues. Bundling articles into journal issues also made sense
given the workflow with analog technologies available since the dawn of
the scientific journal up to the invention of the internet and the web.
It simply made sense, in the print era, to mail issues (collections of
articles) rather than to mail individual articles.</p>
<p>The influence of the print era on current peer-reviewed publishing
practices cannot be underestimated. As <span class="citation"
data-cites="8UJPWJE6">Bartling &amp; Friesike (2014)</span> wrote, the
publishing culture “is affected by the journal system created when
results simply had to be printed on paper” and that now, despite having
digital affordances at our disposal that are limited only by our
imagination, “we are currently in a ‘legacy gap’” (p. 8).</p>
<p>Since we continue to operate as if we use typewriters to write papers
and the postal service to manage communication about the submission and
publication process, I think it is safe to claim that we still reside in
the <em>print era</em>. Although we have gone digital, we have gone
digital superficially. The technologies and workflows we use now are
merely simulacra of what we used before the internet and the web. I find
it easy to believe that if we transported a scientist from the 1970s to
today, and introduced them to the processes we use in 2023, they would
catch on pretty quickly simply because the model is basically the
same.</p>
<p>I believe that some of the big problems that science has today are
the result of mimicking those print-based workflows within a digital
environment. The open access movement is concerned with making the
journal article and other traditional scholarly outputs more accessible.
The open science movement goes further. It is an attempt to make the
entire research process more transparent. This is done by disseminating
and communicating as much of the workflow as possible, which was not
possible at scale in the print era. Although there have always been
barriers to access, the goal of publishing research has long been
fundamentally communicative and about knowledge sharing. The promise
with digital technologies is to provide access to more of the research
process than analog technologies could in the print era. However, since
journals continue to function using a print era model, they will be hard
pressed to truly realize the full potential of open science.</p>
<p>There are many ways we can embrace digital technologies that foster
our pursuit for greater transparency in science. To accomplish this
goal, everything that we do to communicate our research should be
re-evaluated based on the evidence and with the goal to improve science
and its dissemination. Nothing we do should be left unexamined or
unquestioned. Since all technology offers affordances, where such
affordances influence how we act and what we think is possible, we
should reconsider the technologies that we use to review our
manuscripts, communicate our research, structure our papers, disseminate
those papers, organize our end products, and so on.</p>
<p>In this paper, though, my wish is to focus on the journal issue, and
the problems it presents to us as a relic of the print era. I also wish
to present other ways of <em>bundling</em> our output that more fully
embrace digital technologies. My solutions are only suggestions, and I
raise them to stimulate discussion. However, there are two points I want
to make. First, the current way we mimic the print era in our
publication workflow is detrimental to the pursuit of not just science
but also to the pursuit of open science. Second, and more broadly,
instead of leaving progress to random agents, we should collectively and
rationally examine our ways in order to imagine and enact
improvements.</p>
<h1 id="the-journal-issue">The Journal Issue</h1>
<p>Bundling by journal issue has had ramifications on everything from
how scientific output has been organized to how it is retrieved. In this
section, I discuss two overarching ways that journal issues have harmed
the communication of science, and therefore, science itself. First, I
discuss how the print era of bundling created real scarcity and how that
scarcity unjustifiably persisted with the introduction of digital
technologies. Second, I discuss how journal publishers have created
complexity by publishing multiple versions of articles that attempt to
satisfy print era workflows.</p>
<h2 id="scarcity">Scarcity</h2>
<p>Journal articles were bundled by issue because they were printed. It
was economical to release a set of articles in an issue, rather than
mailing each article to subscribers one-by-one. Printing costs limited
the number of pages that journals could print in a single year. This
constraint created scarcity, and scarcity meant that editors had to make
decisions about what to print and what not to print. Even if the
intentions were good, this editorial gatekeeping due to scarcity
probably contributed to the increasing disappearance of papers that
report negative results <span class="citation"
data-cites="7QW5KHFZ">(Fanelli, 2011)</span> and the recognition of a
reproducibility crisis in some scientific disciplines <span
class="citation" data-cites="6255BJ8B">(Nimpf &amp; Keays,
2020)</span>.</p>
<p>Scarcity creates value <span class="citation"
data-cites="TWYYCJXS">(Lynn, 1991)</span>, and this is true for
scholarly publishing <span class="citation"
data-cites="IWIMEVLC">(Taylor, 2012)</span>. One metric of value is the
acceptance rate, which functions as a signal of a commodity’s value and
unavailability. The lower the acceptance rate, the higher the scarcity
value. The acceptance rate of a journal has long been used as an
indicator of a journal’s perceived quality or its value <span
class="citation" data-cites="USMQ2F8G">(Rogers et al., 2007)</span>. A
journal with a 10% acceptance rate is held to higher esteem, all things
being equal, than a journal with a 50% acceptance rate. However, the
acceptance rate of a journal is a function of the print model <span
class="citation" data-cites="6V8SGUUC">(Zuckerman &amp; Merton,
1971)</span>. When space is limited (available print pages per year),
i.e., a journal has page constraints to consider, then its real estate
becomes, by this constraint, prized (<span class="citation"
data-cites="W28UHWAI">Piller (2022)</span>).</p>
<p>Journal-based metrics, such as the <em>Journal Impact Factor
(JIF)</em>, are based on this scarcity value. This means that bundling
by issue has influenced the evaluation of scholarship. The JIF is a
problematic measure of a journal’s impact <span class="citation"
data-cites="V5B8YE59">(Larivière &amp; Sugimoto, 2018)</span>, but it is
a measure that only makes sense when a journal publishes a fairly
constant set of articles per year. That is, in order to measure changes
in average citation counts, whether it is an average over a two or five
year period, it helps to hold at a constant the rate of citable items
(articles) published per year. If the rate of articles that are
published each year varies considerably, then it becomes meaningless to
use the JIF to compare average citation rates across years.</p>
<p>Seeking higher JIF scores becomes a motivation to keep the number of
published articles relatively fixed at the same number each year. The
only reason to keep relatively static the number of articles each year,
especially with digital only journals, is because the JIF is determined
by the ratio of citations to total citable items within a time range. If
journals increase their publication output by eliminating journal issues
and not controlling acceptance rates based on print constraints, then
their JIF scores will drop. This may be why why journals keep producing
hard copy even if it is no longer necessary, or continue to bundle
articles into issues <span class="citation"
data-cites="3RZPSVH3">(Swoger, 2013)</span>. Controlling scarcity has
had a major impact on the production of knowledge. It determines what
can be printed, and it determines how many journals exist. Journals are
created because of supply and demand. If one journal is too restrictive,
offers less space, then it means that other, less restrictive journals
are created to meet demand.</p>
<h2 id="bibliographic-record">Bibliographic Record</h2>
<p>Bundling by journal issue has had ramifications on bibliographic
records, the organization of information, and information retrieval.
Journals that continue to publish hard copy, and therefore, publish by
issue, publish articles as online-first or as ahead-of-print articles,
and think this is satisfactory <span class="citation"
data-cites="W28UHWAI">(Piller, 2022)</span>. These online-first articles
become attached to journal issues at some point in their future, usually
when the journal has caught up with their backlog. The result is that
these articles become versioned: articles online and fully formatted,
but ahead-of-print and not attached to a journal issue, and articles in
print and attached to an issue. This result means that such articles
receive at least two publication dates. The first date reflects the
online-first version. The second date reflects the date of the journal
issue. The time difference between these two versions may be years.</p>
<p>These dates are recorded in the bibliographic record, and
consequently, this impacts information search and retrieval. Consider
two of that U.S. National Library of Medicine’s <em>PubMed</em>’s date
search operators: <a
href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html#dep">Date of
Electronic Publication (DEP)</a> and <a
href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html#dp">Date of
Publication (DP)</a>. The DEP marks “the date the publisher made an
electronic version of the article available.” Therefore, the DEP can be
the date an article was made available online-first and not attached to
an issue. The DP “contains the full date on which the issue of the
journal was published”. This means that some journal articles may have
at least two publication dates. For example, suppose an article is
accepted by some journal and then is quickly made available, generally
as an early access or online-first article, on the journal’s website.
The date that it is made available is the DEP. Later, the article is
assigned to a journal issue, and when that journal issue is released,
the article gets the DP. The bibliographic record for such an article
records these two dates. Each date may be selected in a <em>PubMed</em>
search since these are different date fields in <em>PubMed</em>, but
using one search field rather than the other may mean unintentionally
excluding works that have already been published.</p>
<p>This is an example of mimicking a print-based way of doing things
that’s complicated by a digital-based way of doing things. By mimicking
a print-based workflow in our digital settings, extra steps have been
added to ill effect. In our paper on the reproducibility of search
queries across different MEDLINE platforms <span class="citation"
data-cites="H8ZB2U8T">(Burns et al., 2021)</span>, we showed that a
paper on cancer made available online-first in 2015 was not assigned to
a journal issue until 2019. The online-first version of the paper was
available in <em>PubMed</em> soon after it was available on the
journal’s website as an online-first article, but the four year delay to
assign the paper to an issue meant that the paper was not available in
<em>PubMed</em>’s MEDLINE subset during that four year period. The paper
was therefore invisible to cancer researchers who use MEDLINE and its
controlled vocabulary to finely control their bibliographic searches.
Furthermore, since MEDLINE is available on multiple database platforms
other than <em>PubMed</em>’s, such as <em>Ovid</em>, <em>Web of
Science</em>, <em>EBSCOhost</em>, and <em>ProQuest</em>, we found that
for MEDLINE searches limited by dates at least four years prior to the
searches, bibliographic databases constantly varied the number of search
results over the course of a year of searching because of likely changes
to the bibliographic records. This is surprising. In the print-era,
bibliographic records were largely fixed. Because many journals,
especially those that continue to print hard copy, try to have it both
ways (print and digital workflows), the result is, as described above,
an over-complicated search system. This kind of complication is strictly
the result of cross-walking a print-based workflow onto a digital-based
workflow.</p>
<p>It would be incorrect to assign responsibility to the National
Library of Medicine’s method of managing bibliographic records in PubMed
and MEDLINE. Librarians’ roles are to catalog, document, and organize
publishing information for retrieval. When that publishing information
changes, librarians respond by updating the bibliographic records. The
problem is that the records should not change. If the journal for the
article above ceased mimicking a print-based workflow, by publishing
articles online-first and then later in journal issues, then this
versioning problem would not exist. The journal could stop mimicking a
print-based workflow by ceasing to version their articles based on when
they become available online, as online-first articles, and then by
issue and volume numbers. Issue and volume numbers are strictly a
print-based artifact, put in use to bundle articles into booklets for
snail-based mail. Journals that do not mimic the print-based workflow in
this way do not have this problem. Often these are journals that were
created after the web started and that do not print issues.</p>
<h1 id="solutions">Solutions</h1>
<p>Literature is discovered today largely through general and
specialized search engines, bibliographic databases, and social media
<span class="citation" data-cites="BBQSSXP9">(Burns, 2013)</span>. Few
people, it seems, discover new research by perusing the table of
contents, which again are themselves ordered by when articles are ready
to publish, and not ordered thematically or topically. Although websites
exist that collate articles by topic, there is no reason for journals to
continue the practice of creating tables of contents. It is a
fundamentally poor way to collect and organize unique information
sources like articles, especially for journals that are completely
digital.</p>
<p>Instead, digital journals can create and curate exhibitions and
collections. They can become true digital libraries. Digital libraries
have the advantage of offering multiple ways to organize and classify
the works in their collections (as opposed to volumes), and this creates
opportunities to forge and design web interfaces that match those
collections <span class="citation" data-cites="HKNRR9KR">(Pomerantz
&amp; Marchionini, 2007)</span>. For example, articles can be assigned
to multiple exhibitions and collections based on their main and
secondary topics. By changing to this practice, journals could increase
search engine discoverability and foster browsing and perusal. Browsing
and perusal have long been just as important aspects of information
retrieval as query-based search has been <span class="citation"
data-cites="ADY7ARVY R3I5GWL2">(Bush, 1945; Lesk, 2012)</span>.</p>
<p>In short, journal websites could function as true digital libraries
instead of mimicking the format and practices of hard copy journal
issues. Just as librarians assign multiple subject headings, and thereby
provide multiple access points, to works, journal articles could be
placed in multiple exhibits and collections, thereby increasing the
number of access points and discovery of them. This becomes a matter of
web interface design, information architecture, and curation rather than
simple article bundling based on a first-in, first-out table of contents
print based model. Even for journals that still need to print hard copy,
it is still possible for them to give primacy to a digital workflow
rather than a print workflow. More pointedly, their websites could still
function as digital libraries, as described above, even if they continue
to print journal issues in the traditional way.</p>
<p>We might conclude that many journals, as products of the print era or
as adopters of print workflows, as most continue to exist today, are
themselves obsolete. The future of scientific publishing could be based
on curating and creating digital libraries of scientific and other
scholarly output. Other improvements can be made, too. Articles
themselves can be re-evaluated <span class="citation"
data-cites="SAZLKG8C">(Somers, 2018)</span>. Many journals to this day
publish tables in articles as PDF, JPG, or PNG files, which makes them
largely inaccessible to data extraction and therefore introduce possible
sources of error in meta-analyses which need tabular data from multiple
sources to synthesize statistical calculations. Journals could develop
better relationships with pre-print archives and establish a chain of
providence that links pre-prints to their peer-reviewed outputs. Other
outputs could be more obviously connected to journal articles, such as
data journals and computational notebooks <span class="citation"
data-cites="LU43KXNS">(Perkel, 2018)</span>. This paper was written in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> and synced
to a repository on my <a
href="https://github.com/cseanburns/journal-issues">GitHub</a> account,
which could be a legitimate part of a modern, digital scholarly workflow
<span class="citation" data-cites="FQMA9CVE">(Rougier et al.,
2017)</span> . Acceptance rates could become a thing of the past since
space, theoretically, is unlimited, as the journal <em>eLife</em> is
exploring <span class="citation" data-cites="DJH4SHN5">(Else,
2022)</span>.</p>
<p>In summary, journals could start imagining themselves as part of the
larger scholarly web, which itself was designed to be interconnected,
instead of designing their sites as silos that consider the journal
article as the final, definitive, machine-<em>unreadable</em> end
product. Current scholarly publishing is woefully outdated and remains
loyal to print era workflows and processes. By embracing the digital, we
can avoid multiple publishing dates, give primacy to HTML output, make
articles sources of data (machine readable) and not simply sources for
reading, create greater interoperability, and eliminate the requirement
to submit manuscripts as word processing files <span class="citation"
data-cites="LBXUS5ZD">(Healy, 2019)</span>. With these and other
improvements, such a system would be truly knowledge producing.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Science depends on a communication system, and the current
communication system is largely based on the internet and the web.
Despite that, much of scholarly publishing continues to function as if
it were still in the print era. This is evident in the way journals
continue to publish, for example, by bundling articles into journal
issues. A host of problems arises from this that impacts what journals
publish, how metrics are calculated, how acceptance rates became
prestige markers, and how information is organized and retrieved.</p>
<p>I offered some solutions to improve the way science and scholarship
is published. My goal is to foster discussion since actual solutions
depend on the needs of the communities involved and not on the
desiderata of any specific individual. However, I do believe that my
main solution, re-conceiving the journal as a digital library, is more
aligned with what the internet and the web affords, and that continuing
to apply print era workflows and practices to scholarly publishing is
harmful.</p>
<p>In the end, solutions must be rational, evidence-based, reflective,
aware of scholarly workflows and interconnections, and solved
collectively. The internet and the web have been disruptive, but the
transition to digital publishing has been slow and left to individual
entities to make progress. I believe that we should always ask ourselves
some basic questions: What best serves scholarly communication and
knowledge sharing? Does our current system support what is best? How
does ‘what is best’ vary by discipline?</p>
<p>When digital publishing became available, the affordances offered by
print could be copied over to manuscript management online systems. This
is because these online systems and digital technologies are flexible
and can encompass and mimic print-based affordances. But digital
publishing can afford much more and can better serve science,
scholarship, and knowledge sharing.</p>
