<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Science depends on a communication system. The internet and the web
provide the infrastructure and tools to support aht communicative
system. Yet despite that they have played a developing role as a
communicative system in the last thirty years, they have not truly
changed how peer-reviewed publishing works. We continue to operate
largely on a print-based workflow even if we, the authors and editors
who contribute to our various scholarly and scientific discussions,
mostly work through email and online systems that manage the peer review
and publication processes. These systems mimic the print-based workflows
journals used before the internet and the web. They have not been
transformative even though they involve digital technologies. Authors
may type papers in word processing applications, save those papers as
DOCX files, submit those DOCX files to journal manuscript systems, and
then receive decisions or reviews via those systems. However, the basic
processes are similar to the basic processes used before the internet
and the web. These processes closely mimic the typewriter, the copier,
and the postal service; they do not radically transform the system, nor
do they take advantage of what digital technologies offer.</p>
<p>The internet and the web have also not substantially changed how
journals publish articles. Many journals, even ones that are completely
digital or were born digital, continue to publish journal issues. This
is despite that the journal issue was a device used to bundle journal
articles for hard copy printing. Printing hard copy journal articles as
issues made economical sense. Bundling is a strategy to reduce cost by
packaging multiple products, like journal articles, as one product, like
journal issues. Bundling articles into journal issues also made sense
given the workflow and analog technologies available from the dawn of
the scientific journal up to the invention of the internet and the web.
It simply made sense, in the print era, to mail issues (collections of
articles) rather than to mail individual articles.</p>
<p>The influence of print era cannot be underestimated. As <span
class="citation" data-cites="8UJPWJE6">Bartling &amp; Friesike
(2014)</span> wrote, the publishing culture “is affected by the journal
system created when results simply had to be printed on paper” and that
now, despite having digital affordances at our disposal that are limited
only by our imagination, “we are currently in a ‘legacy gap’”
(p. 8).</p>
<p>Since we continue to operate as if we use typewriters to write papers
and the postal service to manage communication about the submission and
publication process, I think it is safe to claim that we still reside in
the <em>print era</em>. Although we have gone digital, we have gone
digital superficially. The technologies and workflows we use now are
merely simulacra of what we used before the internet and the web. I find
it easy to believe that if we transported a scientist from the 1970s to
today, and introduced them to the processes we use in 2023, they would
catch on pretty quickly simply because the model is basically the
same.</p>
<p>I believe that some of the big problems that science has today is the
result of mimicking those print-based workflows within a digital
environment. The open access movement is concerned with making the
journal article and other traditional scholarly outputs more accessible.
The open science movement goes further. It is an attempt to make the
entire research process more transparent. This is done by disseminating
and communicating as much of the workflow as possible, which was not
possible at scale in the print era. Although there have always been
barriers to access, the goal of publishing research has long been
fundamentally communicative and about knowledge sharing (even if the
incentives have presided elsewhere). The promise with digital
technologies is to provide access to more of the research process than
analog technologies could in the print era. However, since we continue
to function using a print era model, we will be hard pressed to truly
realize the full potential of open science.</p>
<p>There are many ways we can embrace digital technologies that foster
our pursuit for greater transparency in science. To accomplish this
goal, everything that we do to communicate our research should be
re-evaluated based on the evidence and with the goal to improve science
and its dissemination. Nothing we do should be left unexamined or
unquestioned. Since all technology offers affordances, where such
affordances influence how we act and what we think is possible, we
should reconsider the technologies that we use to review our
manuscripts, communicate our research, structure our papers, disseminate
those papers, organize our end products, and so on.</p>
<p>In this paper, though, my wish is to focus on the journal issue, and
the problems it presents to us as a relic of the print era. I also wish
to present other ways of <em>bundling</em> our output that more fully
embrace digital technologies. My solutions are only suggestions, and I
raise them to stimulate discussion. However, there two points I want to
make. First, the current way we mimic the print era in our publication
workflow is detrimental to the pursuit of not just science but also to
the pursuit of open science. Second, and more broadly, instead of
leaving progress to random entities, we should collectively and
rationally examine our ways in order to imagine and enact
improvements.</p>
<h1 id="the-journal-issue">The Journal Issue</h1>
<p>Bundling by journal issue has had ramifications on everything from
how scientific output has been organized to how it is retrieved. In this
section, I discuss two overarching ways that journal issues have harmed
the communication of science, and therefore, science itself. First, I
discuss how the print era of bundling created real scarcity and how that
scarcity became a phantom with the introduction of digital technologies.
Second, I discuss how journal publishers have created complexity by
publishing multiple versions of articles that attempt to satisfy print
era and also digital era workflows.</p>
<h2 id="scarcity">Scarcity</h2>
<p>Journal articles were bundled by issue because they were printed. It
was economical to release a set of articles in an issue, rather than
mailing each article to subscribers one-by-one. Printing costs limited
the number of pages that journals could print in a single year. This
constraint created scarcity, and scarcity meant that editors had to make
decisions about what to print and what not to print.</p>
<p>Scarcity creates value, and one metric of value is the acceptance
rate. The lower the acceptance rate, the higher the scarcity value. The
acceptance rate of a journal has long been used as an indicator of a
journal’s quality. A journal with a 10% acceptance rate is held to
higher esteem, other things being equal, than a journal with a 50%
acceptance rate. The acceptance rate of a journal is a function of the
print model <span class="citation" data-cites="6V8SGUUC">(Zuckerman
&amp; Merton, 1971)</span>. When space is limited (available print pages
per year), i.e., a journal has page constraints to consider, then its
real estate becomes, by this constraint, prized.</p>
<p>Journal-based metrics, such as the <em>Journal Impact Factor
(JIF)</em>, are based on the scarcity value. This means that bundling by
issue has influenced the evaluation of scholarship. The JIF is a
(contested) measure of a journal’s impact, but it is a measure that only
makes sense when a journal publishes a fairly constant set of articles
per year. That is, in order to measure changes in average citation
counts, whether it is an average over a two or five year period, it
helps to hold at a constant the rate of articles published per year. If
the rate of articles that are published each year varies considerably,
then it becomes meaningless to use the JIF to compare average citation
rates across years, even for a single journal.</p>
<p>Seeking higher JIF scores becomes a motivation to keep the number of
published articles relatively fixed at the same number each year. The
only reason to keep static the number of articles each year, especially
with digital only journals, or perhaps even why journals keep producing
hard copy, is because the JIF is determined by the ratio of citations to
total documents printed within a time range. If journals increase their
publication output, then their JIF scores will drop until the citations
can catch up with the new publication rates. This has a major impact on
the production of knowledge. It determines what can be printed, and it
determines how many journals exist. Journals are created because of
supply and demand. If one journal is too restrictive, then it means that
other, less restrictive journals are created to meet demand.</p>
<h2 id="bibliographic-record">Bibliographic Record</h2>
<p>Bundling by journal issue has had ramifications on how bibliographic
records and information retrieval. Journals that continue to publish
hard copy, and therefore, publish by issue, publish articles as online
first, or similarly named, articles. These online first articles become
attached to journal issues at some point in their future, usually when
the journal has caught up with their backlog. The result is that these
articles become versioned: articles online and fully formatted but ahead
of print and not attached to a journal issue, and articles in print and
attached to an issue. This result means that such articles receive at
least two publication dates. The first date reflects the online first
version. The second date reflects the date of the journal issue. The
time difference between these two versions may be years.</p>
<p>These dates are recorded in the bibliographic records, and
consequently, this impacts information search and retrieval. Consider
two of PubMed’s date search operators: <a
href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html#dep">Date of
Electronic Publication (DEP)</a> and <a
href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/mms/medlineelements.html#dp">Date of
Publication (DP)</a>. The DEP marks “the date the publisher made an
electronic version of the article available.” Therefore, the DEP can be
the date an article was made available online first and not attached to
an issue. The DP “contains the full date on which the issue of the
journal was published”. This means that these journal articles may have
at least two publication dates. For example, suppose an article is
accepted by some journal and then is quickly made available, generally
as an early access or online first article, on the journal’s website.
The date that it is made available is the DEP. Later, the article is
assigned to a journal issue, and when that journal issue is released,
the article gets the DP. The bibliographic record for such an article
records these two dates. Each date may be used in a PubMed search since
these are different date fields in PubMed search, and using one search
operator rather than an another may mean unintentionally excluding works
that have already been published.</p>
<p>This is an example of mimicking a print-based way of doing things
that’s complicated by a digital-based way of doing things. By mimicking
a print-based workflow in our digital settings, extra steps have been
added to ill effect. In our paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="H8ZB2U8T">(Burns et al., 2021)</span>, we showed that a
paper on cancer made available “online first” in 2015 was not assigned
to a journal issue until 2019. The online first version of the paper was
available in PubMED soon after it was available on the journal’s website
as an online first article, but the four year delay to assign the paper
to an issue meant that the paper was not available in PubMed MEDLINE
until that issue assignment. The paper was therefore invisible to cancer
researchers who use MEDLINE and its controlled vocabulary to finely
control their bibliographic searches. Furthermore, since MEDLINE is
available on multiple platforms other than PubMed’s, such as Ovid, Web
of Science, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest, we found that for MEDLINE searches
limited by dates at least four years prior to the searches,
bibliographic databases constantly varied the number of search results
over the course of a year of searching because of likely changes to the
bibliographic records. In the print-era, these records were largely
fixed. Because many journals, especially those that continue to print
hard copy, try to have it both ways (print and digital workflows), the
result is overcomplicated searching. This kind of complication is
strictly the result of cross-walking a print-based workflow onto a
digital-based workflow.</p>
<p>It would be incorrect to assign responsibility to the National
Library of Medicine’s method of managing bibliographic records in PubMed
and MEDLINE. Librarians’ roles are to catalog, document, and organize
publishing information for retrieval. When that publishing information
changes, librarians respond by updating the records. The problem is that
the records should not be changing. If the journal for the article above
ceased mimicking a print-based workflow, by publishing articles “online
first” and then later in a journal issue, then this problem would not
exist. It could stop mimicking a print-based workflow by ceasing to
version their articles based on when they become available online, as
online first articles, and then by issue and volume numbers. Issue and
volume numbers are strictly a print-based artifact, put in use to bundle
articles into booklets for snail-based mail. Journals that do not mimic
the print-based workflow, in this way do not have this problem. Often
these are journals that were created after the web started and that do
not print issues.</p>
<h1 id="solutions">Solutions</h1>
<p>Literature is discovered today largely through general and
specialized search engines, bibliographic databases, and social media.
Few people, it seems, discover new research by perusing the table of
contents, which, again, are themselves ordered by when articles are
ready to publish, and not ordered thematically. Although websites exist
that collate articles by topic, there is no reason for journals to
continue the practice of creating tables of contents. Instead, digital
journals can create and curate exhibitions and collections. Articles can
be assigned to multiple exhibitions and collections based on their main
and secondary topics. By changing this practice, journals could increase
search engine discoverability and foster browsing and perusal. In short,
journal websites could function as true digital libraries instead of
mimicking hard copy journal issues. The digital era offers better ways
to bundle articles than simply by when they are ready to publish.
Journal issues bundle articles largely when they are ready to publish.
Unless they are special issues on a topic, journal issues are not
bundled based on a theme. The digital era offers us the ability to
create true digital libraries instead of volumes and issues. Digital
libraries could bundle articles by theme, could create exhibits of
journal articles. Just as librarians are able to assign multiple subject
headings, and thereby access points, to works, journal articles could be
placed in multiple exhibits, thereby increasing the number of access
points and discovery. This becomes a matter of curation rather than
simple bundling based on a first-in, first-out print based model.</p>
<p>IN THE PRINT ERA, A SCIENTIST’S OUTPUT WAS OFFICE ORIENTED (SEE HEALY
ON THIS).</p>
<p>IN THE DIGITAL ERA, A SCIENTIST IS CONNECTED, IS ONLINE, CONDUCTS
THEIR WORK ONLINE, INTERACTS WITH OTHERS ONLINE, AND SO FORTH. tHE
DIGITAL ERA IS FRIENDLY TO THE SCIENTIST’S WORKFLOW. aLSO, RECOGNIZE
THAT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS WITH THIS, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ETC</p>
<p>SCIENCE COMMUNICATION IN THE DIGITAL REALM CAN ENCOMPASS THAT ENTIRE
WORKFLOW AND NOT ONLY THE PRIMARY OUTPUT – THE SCIENTIFIC PAPER.</p>
<ul>
<li>highlighting the scientific workflow enables us to query the
fundamentals of science</li>
<li>this is evident in the open science movement and offers the ability
to test fundamental assumptions about science, scientific
reproducibility, and scientific replication (relatively) small sample
statistics is a good example</li>
</ul>
<p>THERE ARE EFFORTS UNDERWAY TO CAPTURE MORE OF THAT WORKFLOW, AND
THESE EFFORTS VARY BY DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>BUT REGARDLESS OF THE SPECIFIC EFFORTS, MOST JOURNALS STILL EXIST AS
SILOS TO THESE WORKFLOWS.</p>
<p>POINT: BUT ALSO, SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOWS HAVE CHANGED IN THE DIGITAL
ERA, AND JOURNALS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RECOGNIZE AND INCORPORATE THESE
WORKFLOWS INTO THEIR PUBLISHING IN WAYS THAT DO NOT MIMIC SCIENTIFIC
WORKFLOWS IN THE PRINT ERA.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Goal additional: publish HTML only. Include an ability to print
to PDF or a print-focused CSS style sheet. Stop publishing tables as
images. The data should be parsable by software.</p></li>
<li><p>Goal additional: make information extractable generally by
software. The paper itself should be a source of data (for computer
programs) and not just a source of information (for people).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Goal: for scholarly publishing to become fully digital, it needs to
be proactive. It needs to focus on design and research based on
scholarly publishing, including bibliometrics, information retrieval,
information seeking, access, etc. It needs to stop being reactive. It
needs to stop acting as if it was born from a print age. It needs to act
as if was born digital.</p>
<p>Goal revised: get rid of issue based publishing (although there are a
number of other things to do</p>
<p>HOWEVER, THE DIGITAL REALM OFFERS AFFORDANCES THAT COULD BENEFIT
SCIENCE COMMUNICATION.</p>
<ul>
<li>Web paradigm A) Introduction of PloS One in 2003
<ul>
<li>Most journals today are still bound by the print paradigm</li>
<li>PloS One and later megajournals have been able to free themselves of
that paradigm a) articles are published as they become ready b) move
from a journal centric publication model to a article centric
publication model
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>talk about table B) Web paradigm also frees journals to experiment
with different parts of the scientific process</li>
</ol></li>
<li>open peer review a) pit two theoretical frameworks against each
other: - assumption: science “conceived of as a system of communication”
(Merton) - social constructivism (fuzzy authorship) versus the normative
view of science (strong authorship but communism) - fuzzy versus strong
authorship raises epistemological issues about author contributions b)
better view of the scientific workflow</li>
<li>blogging, and other social computing activities, as a certified part
scientific communication process</li>
<li>dissemination of pre-prints to subject and institutional
repositories</li>
<li>dissemination of code to code repositories and managers, such as
GitHub</li>
<li>dissemination of supplementary and non-textual artifacts, such as on
Figshare</li>
<li>collaborative and open view editing of scientific manuscripts
<ul>
<li>better view has enabled better tracking
<ul>
<li>the first instinct was to track for impact (e.g., altmetrics)</li>
<li>but the better view has the potential to offer increased insight
into knowledge creation and management d) additional implications
include:</li>
<li>decentralization of scholarly power (controlled study paper—Merton
effect; information retrieval) e) better view should enable better
codification of knowledge required to conduct science</li>
<li>with increased access to how people do science, there should be
increased access to documenting the scientific workflow</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>THESE AFFORDANCES BEGIN NOT WITH THE OUTPUT, E.G., THE JOURNAL
ARTICLE, AS MOST PUBLISHERS HAVE FOCUSED ON, BUT WITH THE ENTIRE
SCIENTIFIC WORKFLOW.</p>
<p>IN THE PRINT ERA, A SCIENTIST’S WORKFLOW WAS PREDOMINANTLY CAPTURED
IN THE FINAL OUTPUT, THE SCIENTIFIC PAPER (OF COURSE, POSTERS, TALKS,
ETC EXISTED, BUT STILL, THE OUTPUT WAS LIMITED).</p>
<p>ERGO, WE MIGHT CONCLUDE, THAT JOURNALS, A PRODUCT OF THE PRINT ERA,
AS MOST CONTINUE TO EXIST TODAY, ARE THEMSELVES OBSOLETE.</p>
<p>THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING COULD BE BASED ON PORTFOLIOS AND
DIGITAL LIBRARIES. WHEN I FIRST HEARD OF PLOS ONE AND PEERJ, I THOUGHT
THAT WAS WHERE SUCH PUBLISHERS WERE HEADED, BUT MORE CAN BE DONE.</p>
<ul>
<li>Publishing:
<ul>
<li>publish as-ready instead of by issue or volume; the acceptance rate
could be redefined and possible raised since it would no longer be based
on the budget a journal has to publish in print (stop publishing in
print); could increase the speed of publication</li>
<li>by detaching from printing, no longer desk rejecting by word count
or length of paper</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Paper:
<ul>
<li>make HTML only</li>
<li>make paper a source of data</li>
<li>tables should be HTML tables and not images of tables</li>
<li>statistical information should be extractable programmatically</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Emded metadata in HTML; use semantic HTML5</li>
<li>Paper as unit should be archivable; should be self-contained
<ul>
<li>no part of the published web page that a paper is on should rely on
other technologies to display; everything needed to display the page
should be on the single page</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Relationship with preprint archives? Follow chain of providence? For
example, in my PLOS ONE article, there’s no connection, even though I
remember the process stating there would be, to the PLOS ONE article and
the prepint on bioArxiv.</li>
</ul>
<p>THE FUTURE OF SCIENTIFIC PUBLISHING FROM THE SCIENTIST’S PERSPECTIVE,
A SERIES OF TOOLS THAT DO ONE THING AND DO ONE THING WELL.</p>
<p>THESE TOOLS COULD ACT AS PIPES THAT REDIRECT OUTPUT, AUTOMATICALLY,
TO OTHER TOOLS FOR VARIOUS SORTS OF PROCESSING.</p>
<p>Things to take advantage of the digital:</p>
<p>categorize these:</p>
<ul>
<li>no multiple publishing dates</li>
<li>HTML primacy</li>
<li>the ability to extra data from articles,
<ul>
<li>including references</li>
<li>tables</li>
<li>figures/plots</li>
<li>text</li>
<li>statistics</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>make the article a true data source. not just a source for reading,
but a source that is machine readable</p>
<ul>
<li>semantic data in each article
<ul>
<li>html semantic</li>
<li>linked data semantic</li>
</ul></li>
<li>don’t require Microsoft Word
<ul>
<li>allow multiple formats if formats have standards that are open</li>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>What best serves scholarly communication? Or the dissemination of
scholarly output? Does our current system support what is best? How does
‘what is best?’ vary by discipline?</p>
<p>There are two problems with the current system. First, it just
happened. That is, it was not designed. There was no evidence to support
how it developed. It was simply based on existing technologies and
workflows for communicating information. Second, the way it happened was
shaped by the affordances of the technology of the time, which were
print-based affordances.</p>
<p>When digital publishing became available, the affordances offered by
print could be copied over to the online system because an online system
can encompass and include print-based affordances. But digital
publishing can afford much more, and it is a result of our lack of
collective imagination to adopt these new affordances as well as
institutional pressures, like tenure and grant funding, and
self-interest, like number of papers published and number of citations
received and number of “high impact” journals to publish in, and market
forces, that do not incentive journal publishers to adopt what’s best
for science, to keep doing the same thing we did in the 19th and 20th
centuries.</p>
